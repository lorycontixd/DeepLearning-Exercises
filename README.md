# DeepLearning-Exercises
Exam project for "Deep Learning with Applications" course in Physics Master's degree in Universit√† degli Studi di Milano

## Description
Project consists of a player on a 2D grid who tries to find the exit inside of a labyrinth using Reinforcement Learning techniques. 
Firstly, the agent was built using standard vanilla Q-learning techniques with impressive results. Secondly, a Convolutional Neural Network was built to analyze the environment situation of the player as image inputs and drive the player towards the exit.
